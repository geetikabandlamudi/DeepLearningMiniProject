# DeepLearningMiniProject

This Mini project is a part of CS-GY 6953 / ECE-GY 7123 / Deep Learning Course during Spring 2023 at NYU Tandon School of Engineering. In this mini-project we are tasked with coming up with a modified residual network (ResNet) architecture with the highest test accuracy on the CIFAR10 image classification dataset, under the constraint that your model has no more than 5 million parameters. 

We have added the Colab links and the report consisting our findings and arguments in this repository.
